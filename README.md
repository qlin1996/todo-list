# Todo List with Login/Logout

I spent ~3.5 hours on this project (1.5 on the login and 2 on the todos). I could not get the login API to work so I created a function to act like the API for now. When I make a post request, I get the error 'Some of the Required Params were not passed to this script'.

### `yarn start`
